### Hi 🥳

I'm a front-end engineer, like JavaScript, NodeJS, React, Vue and maybe Rust.

- What do I usually do? When I am working, I will write about the company’s business, technology drivers, and manage other front-end programmers. At the same time, I like to write code that interests me and learn other knowledge in my spare time.
